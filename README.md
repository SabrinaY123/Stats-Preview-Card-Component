## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a layer of color over an image using z-index and the opacity elements!!

Also it was my first time using a Mobile-First Workflow and honestly seemed more seamless. (Most likely this is just preference, I think?)

### Continued development

Is centering layouts like this supposed to be so lengthy? I feel like I am doing something wrong because I end up writing so much CSS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped with centering my divs.

- [MDN - Z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)
